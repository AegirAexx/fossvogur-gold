# Fossvogur Gold

## Summary

Fossvogur Gold is an alternate 9 hole layout for the Fossvogur Disc Golf course in Reykjavik. The regular course layout is very beginner friendly and has two sets of tee pads, red and white. For people getting better at the sport there are few choices for more challenging courses. This is an attempt to make a more challenging track for players in Reykjavik and should be good fun for the upcoming intermediate local players in Reykjavik.

## The Course Layout

Fossvogur Gold is a par 30 layout and is roughly 1240 meters or 4068 feet.

The course general flow is that you play from one tee pad to the next basket. During your round you will make two laps of the course.

There is OB everywhere, **ALL WATER IS OB** and there are a bunch of mandatories which should prove difficult for players to navigate.

Missed mandatories are a penalty stroke and the lie is taken within 2m of the missed mandatory.
